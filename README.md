Marketplace Price Analysis
Overview
This repository contains an anonymized Python script designed to extract advertised product prices from a marketplace using web scraping APIs, transform the data into a structured format, and compare prices against a reference price list to identify discrepancies. The script automates the generation of an Excel report with hyperlinks, enabling stakeholders to analyze pricing trends and make data-driven decisions. Developed as part of my work as an SAP Master Data Analyst, this project demonstrates skills in data pipeline development, ETL processes, and business intelligence (BI) reporting.
Purpose
The MarketplacePriceAnalysis script supports business stakeholders (e.g., product or category managers) by providing actionable insights into marketplace pricing. It showcases my expertise in:

Web scraping and API integration for data ingestion.
JSON data transformation into DataFrames for analysis.
Automated reporting with Excel outputs for stakeholder decision-making.
Data pipeline optimization, mirroring workflows in SAP master data management and BI reporting.

This project is relevant to roles requiring data pipeline development, data analysis, and stakeholder collaboration in data engineering and analytics.
Technologies

Python: Core programming language for scripting and data processing.
Libraries:
requests: For API data fetching.
pandas: For DataFrame creation and data manipulation.
openpyxl: For Excel file handling and hyperlink integration.
json: For parsing API responses.
datetime: For timestamped file naming.


APIs: Generic web scraping API (placeholder; replace with actual API, e.g., a retail-focused API).
Output: Excel file with sorted price differences and seller hyperlinks.

Functionality
The script performs the following tasks:

Data Extraction: Fetches offer data (prices, sellers, conditions) for a list of product identifiers using a web scraping API.
Data Transformation: Parses JSON responses into a pandas DataFrame, extracting key fields (e.g., price, seller, condition).
Data Integration: Merges the fetched data with a reference price list (CSV) to align advertised prices with Minimum Advertised Prices (MAP).
Price Comparison: Calculates price differences (advertised price minus MAP) and sorts results to highlight discrepancies.
Reporting: Exports the results to a timestamped Excel file, adding hyperlinks to seller links for stakeholder analysis.

Anonymization
The code has been anonymized to protect sensitive information, ensuring it is safe for public sharing. Specific details, such as the API key, product identifiers, API endpoint, and company-specific references, have been replaced with placeholders (e.g., YOUR_API_KEY, SAMPLE_ID_1, https://api.example.com). The functionality remains intact, demonstrating web scraping, ETL, and reporting capabilities applicable to various marketplaces and datasets.
Setup and Usage
Prerequisites

Python 3.7+
Install required libraries:pip install requests pandas openpyxl


A valid API key for a web scraping service (placeholder: YOUR_API_KEY).
A price list CSV file (e.g., resources/price_list.csv) with columns: MaterialID, ProductID, Description, MAPPrice.

Installation

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/gmmarsh/MarketplacePriceAnalysis.git
cd MarketplacePriceAnalysis


Place your price list CSV in the resources/ directory.
Update the API_KEY variable in the script with your actual API key.
Replace the placeholder product_ids list with your product identifiers.
Update the API endpoint and domain as needed (e.g., replace https://api.example.com/request with the actual service).

Running the Script
Execute the script:
python price_analysis.py

The script will:

Fetch offer data for the specified product IDs.
Generate a text file (YYYY-MM-DD_offers_list.txt) with raw JSON data.
Produce an Excel file (YYYY-MM-DD_marketplace_analysis.xlsx) with sorted price differences and seller hyperlinks.

Example Output
The Excel output includes columns:

ProductID: Unique product identifier.
ItemCode: Marketplace item code.
Price: Advertised price.
MAPPrice: Reference price from the price list.
PriceDifference: Difference between advertised and MAP price.
Seller, SellerLink, ConditionTitle: Seller details and product condition.

The file is sorted by PriceDifference to highlight significant pricing discrepancies, with clickable SellerLink hyperlinks for stakeholder review.
Relevance to Data Engineering
This project aligns with key data engineering and BI tasks:

Data Pipeline Development: Ingests and transforms marketplace data, similar to data lake ingestion processes.
ETL Processes: Extracts (API), transforms (JSON to DataFrame), and loads (Excel) data, mirroring my 50% ETL preprocessing time reduction in SAP workflows.
BI Reporting: Delivers stakeholder-focused insights, akin to my SAP dashboard (100% situational awareness increase) and K-means clustering for inventory optimization.
Stakeholder Collaboration: Supports business decision-making, as seen in my SAP Master Data Analyst roleâ€™s product management support via web scraping and sentiment analysis.

Future Enhancements

Integrate with visualization tools for advanced price trend analysis (in progress, aligning with my Microsoft Certified: Fabric Data Engineer Associate study).
Add support for multiple marketplaces or APIs.
Implement automated alerts for significant price discrepancies.
Enhance error handling for API rate limits or missing data.
